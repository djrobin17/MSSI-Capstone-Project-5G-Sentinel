# Problem Statement
The evolution from 4G to 5G (and 6G soon) cellular networks has led to profound changes in the network architecture, such as a new era of data transfer velocities, reduced latencies, and expanded connectivities. Regardless of these benefits, the advanced frameworks have intricate security vulnerabilities, potentially introducing novel opportunities for attackers. As these networks become more integrated into critical infrastructure and daily life, ensuring their security becomes paramount. One of the most disruptive attacks on these networks is the Denial of Service (DoS) attack, which can paralyze the network, preventing legitimate users from accessing services.

# Proposed Solution
Our proposed solution is to simulate a 5G cellular network environment using the Abot framework, develop a robust threat model tailored to the unique characteristics of 5G technology, and implement an advanced defense mechanism against Denial of Service (DoS) attacks using the Niksun intrusion detection system. In a nutshell, this project is a comprehensive exploration of the security aspects of a 5G cellular network, with the main aim of creating a solution to detect and mitigate threats.
